## Starters

Each starter is a combination of commerce platform and search engine. While each starter follows very similar features crucial for every storefront, they may be different therefore we recommend checking the documentation for each starter.

- [Shopify + Algolia Starter](https://github.com/Blazity/enterprise-commerce/tree/main/starters/shopify-algolia)
- [Shopify + Meilisearch Starter](https://github.com/Blazity/enterprise-commerce/tree/main/starters/shopify-meilisearch)

## Architecture

In Enterprise Commerce high-level architecture, Search Engine serves as the primary source for all product data and potentially other types of data in the future. The system is designed to easily integrate AI personalization tools without needing to modify any frontend code. While we are integrated with Shopify by default, we are not tightly bound to it, you can use any commerce platform and adapt data to our format.

## Performance

At Blazity, we prioritize speed. Enterprise Commerce is meticulously crafted to deliver top-notch performance for your online store.

Lighthouse scores offer a valuable comparison tool, but they don‚Äôt directly translate to SEO or user experience (UX).
For a true picture, prioritize real user data. Tools like CrUX or Vercel Speed Insights provide user-based performance metrics, ensuring your online store delivers a seamless experience for your customers.
